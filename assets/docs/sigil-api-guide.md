        vm      - core of the SigilVM, implements Section 0 (System)

    Auxiliary directories and files (autogenerated and/or ignored by git)
    /sigil/vm/bin
    /sigil/vm/build
    /sigil/vm/sigil.meta.sh
    /sigil/vm/compile_commands.json


### Scripting meta files
    Whenever a sigil suite script is run, it will look for meta file,
    starting in working directory. If none is found, 
    it will go up the file tree, until it finds one.

    file name: sigil.meta.sh

### SigilVM Tree
    vmsr
    |-- platform
    |   |-- iocommon (physical buttons, fans etc)
    |   |-- station (networking manager)
    |   \-- vkhost (vulkan device host)
    \-- runtime
        |-- server (http)
        |-- visor (rendering engine)
        \-- ntt (entity component system)

    Tree nodes are split into 3 sections:  

    Section 0: (System)
    vmsr:
        Virtual machine system root, all state changes to it are issued via
        runtime and platform nodes.
    platform:
        Less dynamic part of API responsible for physical host and connectivity
        and devices.
    runtime:
        Part of API that manages creation and removal of new processes and nodes.
    
    Section 1: (Platform)
    iocommon:
        API for common I/O operation using physical buttons, 4bit lcd,
        uart, signals and x11 events.
    station:
        Manager for platform's network hardware, wifi/radios/ethernet.
        Important for embedded targets like esp8266
    vkhost:
        Wrapper for Vulkan, responsible for creating device, setting up queues etc.
        Configuring a render pass is not a responsibility of this module
        

    Section 2: (Runtime)
    server:
        http/https/ftp/ssh implementation
        Additionally, server runtime module is used for multiplayer aspects of the engine.
    visor:
        Rendering API built using Vulkan, ImGui, glfw
    ntt:
        Entity engine module, organizes content using units called Scenes
    
    Nodes of the tree are represented by vmnode_t struct.

### Sigil Scene Editor: UX/UI

    Main window bar, at the top, can be hidden with a shortcut. (not chosen yet)

    File:
        new
        open
        save
        save as

    Entity Framework (Paged)
    1 - Tree View
    2 - Ref ID Table
    3 - Entity Store

    Main Window (Paged)
    1 - Text Editor with vim motions support + terminal
    2 - Alternate Editor mode: asset editor with support for 3d and 
        4d assets + hex mode memory view style
    3 - Info View like size in memory

    Output Capture:
        Mirror stdout/stderr and other outputs. (with scroll)

    Peek View:
        Shows most relevant info about component or entity.
